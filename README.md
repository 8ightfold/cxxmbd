## cxxmbd

cxxmbd is a set of utilities for embedding and decoding files as binary. It consists of two parts: a command line application, and a header only decoding utility. These can be used in combination to include raw data in your c++ applications, and then decode them on a user's device. Gone is the era of using xxd to create arrays, it's time for c++ to shine!
